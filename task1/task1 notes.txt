The script should ingest a CSV file (local or remote) that contains user information, which
contains the values required to perform the following tasks:
file=$1
IFS=","
while read col1 col2 col3
do
echo "Column 1 value: $col1"
echo "Column 2 value: $col2"
echo "Column 3 value: $col3"
done < $file


• Create each specified user while implementing best practices
• Set a default password for the user based on the user’s birth date
• Create the required secondary groups (if specified and non-existent)
• Assignment to the correct secondary groups (if specified)
• Create the required shared folder (if specified and non-existent)
• Create the required secondary group for the shared folder (if specified and non-existent)
• Assignment of the user to a group to access the shared folder (if specified)
• Creation of a link to the users shared folder (if specified)
• Creation of an alias to shutdown the system (if user is in the sudo group)
• Enforce a password change at first login

sudo useradd batman
sudo passwd batman
echo iambatman
echo iambatman
groupadd secondry
usermod -G secondry someguy
mkdir shared
chown :secondry /home/student/shared
ln shared hardlink
alias lsl="ls -l"

Carefully check the format of the provided file and use it as an example of what parameters your
script must be able to handle. Each row of the sample file represents an individual user. The
sample file contains a header that documents each column in the file. The available columns in
the file are:
• The email address of the user
• The birth date of the user (in the format YYYY/MM/DD, for example, 1991/11/17)
• The secondary groups the user should be added to
• A shared folder that the user requires full access to (full rwx permissions)
